# Changelog

## 2026-02-12 — Chapter screen progress bar
- **Progress bar on chapter intro**: A green progress bar fills smoothly over 5 seconds on the chapter intro screen ("The Forgotten Garden", etc.), showing players exactly how long before it auto-advances
- **Progress bar on chapter complete**: Same treatment on the chapter complete celebration screen (6-second duration)
- **Smooth animation**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout` for butter-smooth fill; properly cleans up on early tap dismiss
- Files changed: `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/story.js`

## 2026-02-12 — Watering can tilt + water progress ring
- **Watering can tilt**: Increased tilt angle from -0.6 to -0.85 radians (~49°) and faster tilt speed for a more dramatic, visible pouring animation when the can is over a plant pot
- **Water progress ring on pot**: Added a prominent circular progress bar around the plant pot that fills as the player holds the watering can over it — clear visual feedback for dementia patients showing "keep holding here"
- **Water drop icon**: A 💧 emoji follows the leading edge of the progress ring for extra clarity
- Files changed: `js/garden.js`
