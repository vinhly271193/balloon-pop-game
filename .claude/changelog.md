## 2026-02-12 — Watering can tilt + water progress ring
- **Watering can tilt**: Increased tilt angle from -0.6 to -0.85 radians (~49°) and faster tilt speed for a more dramatic, visible pouring animation when the can is over a plant pot
- **Water progress ring on pot**: Added a prominent circular progress bar around the plant pot that fills as the player holds the watering can over it — clear visual feedback for dementia patients showing "keep holding here"
- **Water drop icon**: A 💧 emoji follows the leading edge of the progress ring for extra clarity
- Files changed: `js/garden.js`
